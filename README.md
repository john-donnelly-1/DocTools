# DocTools

# This was created to save some of the Google Apps Script functions I use to save a little time during my meetings
# The first set of functions (addHeader) finds the name of the meeting on your google calendar, and creates a date header along with some template bullets
# The second set of function (taskCreator) takes the sub-bullets under the To Do's bullet added above, and turns them into tasks, which I have show up on my google calendar
